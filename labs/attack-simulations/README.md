# Attack Simulations — Security Labs

This section contains hands-on attack simulations performed in isolated lab
environments to study common network, wireless, and application-layer attacks.

The purpose of these labs is to understand:
- How attacks impact availability, confidentiality, and integrity
- How attackers operate at different layers
- How defensive and mitigation strategies can be applied

All experiments were conducted on systems owned or explicitly authorised
for testing, strictly for educational purposes.
